# 1. Implements Ackley Function 
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Reference: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ackley.html
#
# Description: The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms. In its 
# two-dimensional form, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at
# the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing 
# algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima.
#
# Input Domain:
# The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-32.768, 32.768], for all i = 1, 2,..., d,
# although, it may also be restricted to a smaller domain.
#
# Global Minimum:
# f(X') = 0, at X' = (0, ..., 0)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------
#

# 2. Implements Buckin N. 6 Function 
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Reference: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/bukin6.html
#
# Description: The sixth Buckin function has many local minima, all of which lie in a ridge. 
# 
# Dimensions: 2.
#
# Input Domain:
# The function is usually evaluated on the rectangle  x1 ∈ [-15, -5], x2 ∈ [-3, 3].

# Global Minimum:
# f(X') = 0, at X' = (-10, 1)

# 3. Implements Cross-In-Tray Function

# Reference: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/crossit.html
#
# Description: The Cross-in-Tray function has multiple global minima. 
# 
# Dimensions: 2.

# Input Domain:
# The function is usually evaluated on the square xi ∈ [-10, 10], for all i = 1, 2.
#
# Global Minima:
# f(X') = -2.06261, at X' = (1.3491, -1.3491), (1.3491, 1.3491), (-1.3491, 1.3491)
