# 1. Implements Beale Function 
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Reference: https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/beale.html
#
# Description: The Beale function is multimodal with sharp peaks at the corners of 
# the input domain.
#
# Input Domain:
# The function is usually evaluated on the square xi âˆˆ [-4.5, 4.5], for all i = 1, 2.
#
# Global Minimum:
# f(X') = 0, at X' = (3, 0.5)
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------
